# Community Mod Framework

The Community Mod Framework aims to support compatibility between different mods.

# Philosophy

This framework aims to preserve base game behavior by default.
So if no other mod is used, the framework aims to be invisible to players.

The goal is to provide mods that make use of it, new ways to show content or hook into base game functionality.

# Setting Dependency

To set this mod as a dependency to your own mod, you will need to add this to your `metadata.json` file:
```
  "relationships" : [
    {
      "rel_type" : "dependency",
      "id" : "com.github.Europa-Universalis-5-Modding-Co-op.community-mod-framework",
      "display_name" : "Community Mod Framework",
      "resource_type" : "mod",
      "version" : "1.*"
    }
  ]
```
**Also remember to add the mod to your required items on your own mods steam page.**
